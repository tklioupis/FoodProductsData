# FoodProductsData

This is a project that I am currently working on for an Online Course I am having through Coursera.
The goal of the assignment is to choose a data source, retrieve the data and store them on a DataBase.
I have chosen Open Food Facts, which is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone. You can check it here https://world.openfoodfacts.org/.
